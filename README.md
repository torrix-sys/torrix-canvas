# Torrix Canvas

Torrix Canvas is a conceptional/experimental Desktop Environment, which is based on Torrix network.

Basically, the whole Torrix Canvas system is based on the web-based view.

But it's not just a classical one. It mainly uses WebAssembly, and WebGPU too, if necessary.

This means that your whole desktop environment, or applications can be ported to Web Browsers so easily.

Also, based on this system, you can also make your 'Torrix Home'.

Torrix Home is a web-based view which can represent your Author identity of the Torrix network.

Just like other packages, it's based on Torrix Git system.

The people can browse your dedicated website, and see your software list and your vision.

If you are online, you will be able to see who visited your home or messages they sent to you.

Also, if you want some software documentations, you can also use Torrix Docs.

Torrix Docs has basically same architecture, but it's dedicated to certain package, not the author.

It's best to serve Torrix Home or Tor Docs via Torrix Server Relays.

Even without relays, the people would be able to download them like static websites, but with server relays on, they will be communicate with other people, and especially with the original author.

Since the Canvas is based on webview, the features can be extended in so many ways.

For example, with using Bitcoin Lightning Network, the people will be able to credit the software authors.

Considering that so many open-source authors are being underpaid depite their tremendous contribution to the open source community, donating to them will supor-boost the whole open source ecosystem unlike any before.

Also, some might considering implementing WebVR feature.

With that, people would be able to distribute software like Torrix Game, or Torrix Site.

It means that software developers can expect getting paid more Bitcoin with Lightning Network, not only hoping other people's voluntary donation.

So, ideally, people can already expect the best development environment with the Torrix System, but with Torrix Canvas, they can even expect it to the 'perfect' level.
